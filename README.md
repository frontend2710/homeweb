![alt text](https://github.com/frontend2710/homeweb/blob/main/images/vieww.jpg)
# implementation details
I have designed this webpage using Bootstrap,CSS3,HTML5 and Javascript.The basic layout is a grid.As the entire page can be divided into 12 parts in grid system,I have alloted 7 parts of it to property listing and 5 parts to the embedded google map.Have used cards along with grid in individual property listing,and I have used caraousel to perform the image sliding functionality.Fontawesome icons have been used for villa,parking and other features.
# Improvements
Due to time constraint,I have used internal css,however it can be mived to common css file.
